We can solve this issue in two ways.

1. We can do a linear search for each version and identify the first bad version.
   Time Complexity - O(n)
   This solution doesn't beacuse it leads to TLE

2. Second way is that we can implement a binary search for all version and identify the first version that results in bad.
   TimeComplexity - O(log n)
   This solution was accepted without any TLE
